# Week01

## Content

Research games, create a list of games inspiration on your team’s repo. Make sure your team has plenty of options. Consider adding notes to each game (what makes it great?) and perhaps even ranking them by suitability and interest.

## Game Ideas

| Game | Mechanics                  |

| Portal 2D            | <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-22/blob/main/images/Portal.png" width="500"><br>1. Physical Engine: For instance, the trajectory of bullets, the gravity, the speed of the matchstick man and the movements of the matchstick man should all be considered.<br>2. Puzzle solving: The players should brainstorm to solve the different puzzles to arrive the goal, such as they should plan where should they go first to trigger some mechanism or they may fall in traps.<br>3. bject collision: The matchstick man can’t pass through some walls or jump over some mechanisms. The players should generate portals to pass them instea.d<br>4. Multiple levels: The difficulty will increase level by level. For example, the players might use more portal in the late levels, or have to spend more time to think about how to arrive the goal. |
| Hotline Miami     | <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0166/2025-group-22/blob/main/images/Hotline Miami.png" width="500"><br>1. Attack Methods: Follow the mouse. Melee weapons have a semicircular attack range around the player, and their speed decays with distance when the weapen was being thrown. Firearms and throwing weapons follow the mouse direction.<br>2. Bullets: Different items have different bullet speeds and spreads. This can be achieved by setting random values within different ranges.<br>3. Movement Speed: The movement speed of the player and different types of enemies is fixed but varies between them.<br>4. Walls: Players will be detected around glass walls, and bullets can pass through the glass. Moving behind solid walls will prevent the detection of enemies and block their bullets. This is determined by detecting if the player is staying behind solid walls.<br>5. Death: The player dies instantly when being hit and restart from the checkpoint.<br>6. Victory Condition: The level is cleared when all enemies are detected to be eliminated and the game is saved. |

4. Portal 
Game mechanics:
Portal Gun: the player uses the device to create two connected portals for travelling through walls, floors and obstacles.
Physics Puzzle: Solve puzzles using gravity, inertia and the properties of the portals, such as jumping to hard-to-reach areas.
Linear levels: Each level is designed with independent puzzles that gradually guide the player through complex techniques.


5. Papers, Please 
Game mechanics:
Border Inspection: Players take on the role of an immigration officer who examines the passports and documents of those entering the country and decides whether to release or deny them.
