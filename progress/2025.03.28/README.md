# 2025.03.28

## Done

1.Testing
2.add operation prompt in sample level
3.modify the collision volume
4.Adjust the code structure

## Issue

1.The game will freeze when entering pauseUI
2.The game will also get stuck when adding test code
3.The design of the elf picture is a bit simple
4.More reasonable level designs are needed(In the second level, monsters and reflection walls appear. In the third level, Goblin fire-breathing dragons appear)
5.the test code may affect the main function right now

## To do (for two week)

1.Sustainability & Accessibility (WQ, QW)
2.Change the elf's picture (GC)
3.repair pauseUI (YC, HR)
4.Improve the test code (HX)
5.Level design (more reasonable) (HX)
