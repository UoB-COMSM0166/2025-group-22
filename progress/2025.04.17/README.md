## Done

1.add opening and closing animations
2.Design buttons
3.redrawn the bullet and the mouse
4.the color diagram of the gun
5.Modify the jumping height, falling speed and acceleration of the character
6.Write background story

## Issue

1.It would be better if the level map were changed to a tower
2.It's still a bit difficult for people who are just getting started with the game to play (maybe some additional hints are needed).
3.Some players want to play on mobile phones
4.Players cannot directly enter those levels without passing the later ones

## To do (for two week)

1.add death animation (WQ)
2.regenerate UI interface (GC, HR)
3.add an internal prompt bar in the game (HX)
4.Screen Responsiveness (QW)
5.reasonable design of level UI(add lock) (QW, YC)
