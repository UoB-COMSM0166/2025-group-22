## Done

1.Game Script
2.level maps
3.correct maps

## Issue

1.key m to show the guide UI
2.show the key and the exit gate
3.clarify that splike would not affect the bullet reflect
4.test case

## To do (for two week)

1.modify the level map (HX)
2.test case (HX)
3.pixel art consistent (GC, HR)
4.quantitative evaluation (YC, WQ)
5.sample level (GC, QW)

# 2025.03.21

## Done

1.modify the level map
2.test case
3.pixel art consistent
4.quantitative evaluation
5.sample level

## Issue

1.The test is not comprehensive yet
2.The size issue of character collisions makes the level a bit difficult
3.The structure of the code is a bit chaotic

## To do (for two week)

1.Testing
2.Software Quality
3.add operation prompt in sample level
4.modify the collision volume
5.Adjust the code structure

# 2025.03.28

## Done

2.Software Quality
3.add operation prompt in sample level
4.modify the collision volume
5.Adjust the code structure

## Issue
1.The game will freeze when entering pauseUI
2.The game will also get stuck when adding test code
3.The design of the elf picture is a bit simple
4.More reasonable level designs are needed(In the second level, monsters and reflection walls appear. In the third level, Goblin fire-breathing dragons appear)
5.the test code may affect the main function right now

## To do (for two week)

1.Sustainability & Accessibility
2.Change the elf's picture
3.repair pauseUI
4.Improve the test code 
5.Level design (more reasonable)

2.Change the elf's picture
3.repair pauseUI
4.Improve the test code 
5.Level design

## Issue

1.The user needs to use the username at the beginning to record
2.The game requires more abundant elements(sound effect like gunfire, get the key to open the door, get the heart when injured)
3.The game may require multiple routes
4.The dragon in the third level can't shoot fire
5.The same portal needs to be refreshed when it is shot from another direction or with another gun

## To do (for two week)

1.Privacy & Coursework
2.add sound effect
3.Level design (Multiple routes)
4.refactor
5.Modify the logic of the dragon and the fireball
6.Add portal refresh mechanism

## Issue

1.some players need the record of time to challenge themselves
2.The air wall in the game makes the picture unattractive
3.Some players indicated that jumping from the W button did not conform to their habits
4.Sometimes the reflection of bullets may have problems
5.The game screen does not display normally when zooming

## To do (for two week)

1.Adjust the transparency of the air wall
2.add timer
3.algorithm optimization
4.Modify the operation key positions(space to jump,c to change pistol)
5.design the player's and enemies' animation when moving
6.Adjust the zooming

## Done

1.Adjust the transparency of the air wall
2.add timer
3.algorithm optimization
4.Modify the operation key positions
5.design the player's and enemies' animation when moving

## Issue

1.The game is a bit boring (it requires the opening and closing animation of each level).
2.The picture style is too old-fashioned (buttons, bullets)
3.The movement and jumping speed of the characters is unreasonable
4.The player have no idea what kind of wall is in his hand

## To do (for two week)

1.add opening and closing animations
2.Design buttons
3.redrawn the bullet and the mouse
4.the color diagram of the gun
5.Modify the jumping height, falling speed and acceleration of the character
6.Write background story

5.Modify the jumping height, falling speed and acceleration of the character
6.Write background story

## Issue

1.It would be better if the level map were changed to a tower
2.It's still a bit difficult for people who are just getting started with the game to play (maybe some additional hints are needed).
3.Some players want to play on mobile phones
4.Players cannot directly enter those levels without passing the later ones

## To do (for two week)

1.add death animation
2.regenerate UI interface
3.add an internal prompt bar in the game
