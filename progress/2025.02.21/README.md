# 2025.02.21

## Done

1.First Version (can play but not smooth)

## Issue

1.portal not place the right way
2.pixel art not consistent (would be better if we have game story)
3.if player touching the splike just one health, some people would go through the splike, no using portal
4.too hard to pass the game
5.Some class have the same code(e.g. Portal and nonSolid)

## To do

1.Game script (YC)
2.level maps modify (HX)
4.Debug (QW, WQ)
5.Pixel art and show the correct items (GC, HR)
