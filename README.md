## Project Report

### Introduction

Twilight Seeker is a puzzle platformer that combines spatial teleportation with precise control mechanics. Players must strategically use two types of portals to traverse and solve intricately designed mazes. Inspired by two classic games — Super Mario and Portal — we blended the responsive movement of Super Mario with Portal’s portal-based navigation system.

Additionally, we have introduced the "reflection wall" mechanism: bullets bounce back according to the direction they enter, requiring players to predict the bullet trajectory and combine it with the portal to achieve optimal position.

The player’s main goal is to collect the keys and reach the exit gate while avoiding the enemy's attacks. The character is controlled using the keyboard for movement and the mouse to shoot portals. As the game progresses, players will encounter moving enemies and multi-layered teleportation combinations, which not only test their reactions but also challenge their spatial reasoning skills.

We also strongly encourage players to explore. To support this, each level is designed with multiple routes and includes a scoreboard function to record the time taken to complete it. After each run, players can see whether they’ve improved on their previous completion time.

This project is written in JavaScript and utilizes the p5.js library to implement visuals and physics effects. In addition to realizing core game functions, we are committed to delivering a smooth player experience by ensuring that essential information is always accessible through the game interface. Accordingly, we clearly display the player’s health, key count, and pistol status, and provide each interface with a consistent title and options layout. We also strive to give responsive feedback to every player’s action, further enhancing the overall user experience.

We believe that Twilight Seeker can bring an unprecedented experience for players who enjoy thinking strategically and pushing their operational limits.
